Not very long ago we were commissioned by an oil exploration client 
to return to Northern Kenya to carry out aerial photography of the 
Volcanic Barrier in the Lake Turkana region. It turned out to be the 
most spectacular and only way of seeing this remote area of the African 
continent. 

Setting the helicopter down on the edges of caldera so the pilot 
could have a cigarette, left us in no doubt how insignificant the 
human race was in the face of such dramatic nature.
